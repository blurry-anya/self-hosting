Nice üöÄ ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great next step. Let‚Äôs walk through it clearly:

---

## **1. Which distribution to use for Kubernetes VMs?**

For a **home lab Kubernetes node**, you want a lightweight, stable Linux distro with good community support. Here are the best options:

* **Ubuntu Server LTS (recommended)**

  * Most Kubernetes tutorials (kubeadm, k3s, microk8s) assume Ubuntu.
  * Easy package management and networking setup.
  * Pick `22.04 LTS` (long-term support).

* **Debian (also great)**

  * Minimal, rock solid, slightly less ‚Äúhand-holding‚Äù than Ubuntu.
  * Perfect if you want to stay closer to Proxmox‚Äôs base system (since Proxmox is Debian-based).

* **Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux (RHEL-based)**

  * Closer to enterprise Kubernetes environments.
  * Heavier for a small lab, but good practice if you want SRE roles in companies that use RHEL.

üëâ Since you‚Äôre experimenting and already know Linux/Docker, I‚Äôd suggest:

* **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** for simplicity and compatibility.

---

## **2. Where to get it in Proxmox?**

In Proxmox, VMs are created from **ISO images** that you upload to your Proxmox storage.

Steps:

1. Go to the [Ubuntu Server downloads page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).

   * Download `22.04.4 LTS (amd64)` ISO.
2. In the **Proxmox web UI**:

   * Navigate to **Datacenter ‚Üí Your Node ‚Üí Local (storage) ‚Üí ISO Images**
   * Click **Upload**, then select the ISO file you downloaded.
3. Now, when you create a new VM in Proxmox, the ISO will appear as an installation source.

---

## **3. Creating the VM for Kubernetes**

When you create the VM:

* **System**:

  * Machine type: default (Q35 or i440fx)
  * BIOS: `OVMF (UEFI)` if you want modern boot, `SeaBIOS` if you want max compatibility
* **CPU**: 2 cores (start small)
* **RAM - MEMORY**: 4GB (minimum for Kubernetes control plane; use 8GB if available)
* **Disk**: 20GB+ (thin-provisioned so it only uses what‚Äôs needed)
* **Network**: bridged (so the VM gets a LAN IP and can talk to other devices/nodes)

---

üëâ That gets you an Ubuntu VM ready to install Kubernetes (`k3s` or `kubeadm`).

---

Do you want me to also show you a **minimal VM layout** (like how many VMs for master/worker nodes, how much RAM/CPU each) that fits well on your old laptop? That way you won‚Äôt overload Proxmox right away.

Q ABOUT CACHE

Good question üëç disk cache settings in Proxmox can be a bit confusing when you first see them.

When you configure a VM disk, you‚Äôll see **Cache** options like:

* **Default (No cache)**
* **Write through**
* **Write back**
* **Write back (unsafe)**
* **Directsync**
* **None**

---

### **What do these mean in practice?**

* **No cache / Directsync**

  * The VM writes directly to Proxmox storage.
  * Safest option ‚Äî no data loss if the host crashes.
  * Slightly slower performance.
  * ‚úÖ Best for **databases, Kubernetes nodes, critical VMs**.

* **Write back**

  * VM writes go into host‚Äôs page cache first (RAM), then flushed to disk.
  * Much faster, but risk of data loss if the host crashes before flush.
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è Only safe if your host storage has a **battery-backed cache** (e.g., enterprise RAID card).

* **Write back (unsafe)**

  * Same as write back, but ignores flush requests from the VM.
  * Can give the fastest performance, but highest risk of corruption.

* **Write through**

  * Writes go to cache *and* disk simultaneously.
  * Safer than write back, but slower.

* **None**

  * VM manages cache directly, bypassing host cache.
  * Similar to ‚Äúno cache,‚Äù sometimes faster depending on workload.

---

### **For your case (Kubernetes VM on a laptop):**

* Stick with **No cache (default)** or **Directsync**.
* Reason: you don‚Äôt have RAID or battery-backed storage, so speed gains from caching aren‚Äôt worth risking corruption if your laptop crashes or loses power.

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Use **Default (No cache)** for Kubernetes nodes. It‚Äôs safe and consistent.
If later you create a **non-critical VM** (like a testing machine or a media server), you could experiment with **Write back** to see the performance difference.

---

Do you want me to also explain the **bus type** choice (IDE, SATA, SCSI, VirtIO), since that also impacts performance quite a bit?

q: in cpu conf, what is type for? i have defaultly selected x86-64-v2-AES

Great question üôå ‚Äî that CPU **Type** setting in Proxmox is *really important* for VM performance and compatibility, so let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## **What does CPU Type mean in Proxmox?**

It defines **what CPU features are exposed to the VM**.

* Your physical CPU (on the laptop) has a set of instruction sets (SSE, AVX, AES, etc.).
* Proxmox can either:

  * Pass through *all host CPU features* ‚Üí maximum performance, but less portable.
  * Emulate a ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù CPU ‚Üí more compatible, but less optimized.

---

## **Common CPU Types**

* **Default (kvm64 / qemu64)**

  * Generic, very compatible.
  * Minimal CPU features ‚Üí can be slow.
  * Usually only chosen for *live migration between different CPU models*.

* **x86-64-v2-AES** (what you saw)

  * Generic modern x86\_64 CPU with AES instructions.
  * Adds support for things like AES encryption acceleration.
  * Safe for modern distros, more efficient than kvm64.

* **host**

  * Passes *your exact CPU model* and all features into the VM.
  * Best performance (no emulation).
  * Downside: you can‚Äôt live-migrate the VM to a different machine with a different CPU.

* **Other named models (Haswell, Skylake, etc.)**

  * Useful if you want to standardize across a cluster with different CPUs.
  * Locks the VM to a specific ‚Äúvirtual CPU generation.‚Äù

---

## **For your Kubernetes VM**

Since you‚Äôre running this on **one laptop only** (not a multi-node Proxmox cluster where migration matters):
üëâ Set CPU **Type** to **host**.

* You‚Äôll get the **best performance**, especially for workloads that can use newer CPU instructions.
* It avoids unnecessary emulation overhead.

---

‚ö° Example: If you leave it on `x86-64-v2-AES`, your VM won‚Äôt see all of your CPU‚Äôs advanced features like AVX2 or AVX-512 (if supported). With **host**, Kubernetes workloads (and things like crypto or compression) will run faster.

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation for you:**

* Use **host** for Kubernetes nodes.
* Only use generic types (like `x86-64-v2-AES`) if you plan to migrate VMs between very different hardware in the future.

---

Do you also want me to explain **sockets vs cores** in the CPU config (since Kubernetes scheduling can behave differently depending on how you present them)?

q: okk, in network i have model set to VirtIO (paravirtualized). should i stick to it?

Yes üëç you should absolutely stick with **VirtIO (paravirtualized)** for networking in your Kubernetes VM.

Here‚Äôs why:

---

## **Network model options in Proxmox**

* **E1000 / RTL8139 / vmxnet3**

  * Emulated physical NICs (Intel/Realtek/VMware).
  * Good compatibility with old OSes.
  * Slower because every packet has to be emulated.

* **VirtIO (paravirtualized)**

  * Special ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù driver made for virtualization.
  * No emulation ‚Üí much faster throughput, lower CPU overhead.
  * Supported out of the box in modern Linux (kernel has the `virtio_net` driver).
  * ‚úÖ Recommended for **Linux servers**, Kubernetes nodes, Docker hosts, etc.

---

## **For your Ubuntu/Kubernetes VM**

* Stick with **VirtIO** (paravirtualized).
* Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS includes the drivers by default ‚Üí no manual setup needed.
* You‚Äôll get near ‚Äúbare metal‚Äù network performance.

---

‚ö° One tip:
When you create more VMs later and want them to talk to each other (like Kubernetes master ‚Üî worker), make sure they‚Äôre on the **same Proxmox bridge (vmbr0)**. That way, they‚Äôll get IPs on your LAN and be able to communicate directly.

---

‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Keep **VirtIO**. It‚Äôs the best choice for your case.

---

Do you want me to also walk you through how to set the **bridge (vmbr0)** vs NAT mode in Proxmox networking, so your K8s VMs are reachable on your LAN (not just from Proxmox)?

q: im installing ubuntu now, do i need openssh installed?

Yes ‚Äî **install OpenSSH** when setting up Ubuntu Server. üöÄ

Here‚Äôs why:

* Without SSH, you‚Äôd only be able to access the VM via the **Proxmox console** (the web UI shell). That‚Äôs fine for emergencies, but it‚Äôs clunky for daily use.
* With SSH, you can connect from your laptop or another machine:

  ```bash
  ssh user@<vm-ip>
  ```
* It makes managing Kubernetes (and later Docker, configs, Ansible, etc.) way easier.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation:

* During Ubuntu Server install, check **‚ÄúInstall OpenSSH server‚Äù**.
* After install, you‚Äôll immediately be able to connect to your VM via its IP.

---

‚ö° Best practice (optional for later):

* Disable password login ‚Üí use SSH keys instead.
* Restrict SSH to your LAN (via firewall) or set up VPN before exposing it to the internet.

---

Do you want me to also give you a step-by-step on setting up **SSH keys** right after Ubuntu finishes installing? That‚Äôll make your Kubernetes node access secure and smooth.

Exactly üëç during Ubuntu Server installation you‚Äôll see an option like:

> **‚ÄúImport SSH identity‚Äù**
> (or *‚ÄúImport SSH key from GitHub/Launchpad/URL‚Äù*).

---

### üîë What that means

Ubuntu can automatically pull your **public SSH key** from a service (like GitHub) or from a given URL, and install it into the VM‚Äôs `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
That way, after install, you can log in via SSH **without needing a password**.

---

### Options you have

1. **If you already have SSH keys on your laptop/PC**

   * Run this command on your PC:

     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```

     (or `id_ed25519.pub` if you used ed25519 keys).
   * Copy the whole line (it starts with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`).
   * During Ubuntu install, choose **‚ÄúImport from URL‚Äù** (if you put the key somewhere online, like GitHub)
     OR
     after installation, paste it manually into the VM‚Äôs `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

2. **If you don‚Äôt have SSH keys yet**

   * On your PC, generate one:

     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
     ```
   * Accept defaults (it creates keys in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).
   * Then either restart the Ubuntu installer and import it, or add it later after install.

3. **Skip SSH key import for now**

   * If you don‚Äôt provide a key during installation, Ubuntu will just enable password login for SSH.
   * You can log in with the password you set during install.
   * Later you can add your keys manually.

---

‚úÖ Since you‚Äôre just starting, I‚Äôd suggest:

* **Enable OpenSSH Server** during install.
* Skip key import if you‚Äôre unsure.
* Log in via SSH with your password.
* Then I can walk you through adding your SSH key later (safer + more convenient).

---

üëâ Do you want me to prepare the **post-install steps** for setting up SSH keys properly once your Ubuntu VM finishes installing?


SKIP ANY SNAPS

MORE INFO ABOUT SSH

Absolutely ‚Äî this is a really good thing to understand before you go further.

When Ubuntu asks you about **SSH keys** during install, it‚Äôs offering you a way to set up **key-based authentication** instead of (or alongside) password logins.

---

## üîë How SSH key authentication works

1. **You have a keypair on your PC/laptop**:

   * **Private key** ‚Üí stays only on your machine (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
   * **Public key** ‚Üí can be shared freely (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).

2. **On the server (your Ubuntu VM)**:

   * The public key is stored in a file:

     ```
     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   * When you try to log in via SSH, the server checks if your client can prove it has the matching private key.

3. **Login flow**:

   * You type:

     ```bash
     ssh ubuntu@<vm-ip>
     ```
   * Your client presents a cryptographic proof that it has the private key.
   * If the server finds your public key in `authorized_keys` ‚Üí you‚Äôre in.
   * ‚úÖ No password is needed.

---

## üÜö Key login vs Password login

* **Password login**

  * Easier for beginners (just type your VM user password).
  * Less secure if the VM is ever exposed to the internet (passwords can be brute-forced).
* **Key login**

  * Far stronger security (can‚Äôt brute force the crypto).
  * Also much more convenient once set up ‚Äî no typing passwords every time.
  * You can even add a passphrase to your private key for extra safety.

---

## üöÄ In your Ubuntu install

* If you **import your SSH key** (from GitHub or paste it in):

  * After install, you can log in directly with:

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@<vm-ip>
    ```
  * And you won‚Äôt need a password.
* If you **skip it**:

  * OpenSSH will still be installed, but you‚Äôll log in with the username + password you set during installation.
  * Later, you can add your public key manually by appending it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

---

## üîß Practical workflow for you

1. On your PC, check if you already have keys:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.ssh/*.pub
   ```

   If you see `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have one.
2. If not, generate one:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
   ```
3. Copy the `.pub` content into the installer when it asks (or skip and add later).

---

üëâ Question for you: do you want to **import your SSH key right now during install**, or would you prefer to finish with password login first and then I walk you through adding your key afterwards?

A LOT OF DEBUGGING - ENDED UP USING CONFIG FOR SSH:
Ah, this log explains a lot. The main points are:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing `known_hosts` file

* SSH on your Windows machine is looking for:

  ```
  C:\Users\<your_user>\.ssh\known_hosts
  ```
* It **doesn‚Äôt exist**, so SSH can‚Äôt check the server‚Äôs fingerprint automatically.
* That‚Äôs why it shows:

  ```
  The authenticity of host '192.168.x.x' can't be established
  ```

‚úÖ This is **normal the first time you connect to a host**. SSH asks you to confirm that this server is trusted.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to fix / proceed

1. When prompted:

   ```
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
   ```

   * Type `yes` and press Enter.
   * SSH will create the `known_hosts` file and store the fingerprint.

2. After that, the warning won‚Äôt appear for this host anymore.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ About your key not being used yet

* After you accept the host, SSH will still ask for a password if it **doesn‚Äôt see your private key**.
* Make sure to explicitly use the key if you imported it:

```powershell
ssh -i C:\Users\<your_user>\.ssh\<your_private_key> ubuntu@192.168.x.x
```

* Or configure `~/.ssh/config` like:

```
Host myvm
    HostName 192.168.x.x
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile C:\Users\<your_user>\.ssh\<your_private_key>
```

Then you can just run:

```powershell
ssh myvm
```

---

If you want, I can give a **step-by-step ‚ÄúWindows ‚Üí Ubuntu VM‚Äù SSH login setup** that guarantees key-based login works without asking for password. It‚Äôs just a few commands.


Perfect, now that you have SSH access to your Ubuntu VM, we can move on to installing Kubernetes. Since you‚Äôre just starting and want something lightweight for experimentation, I‚Äôd recommend **MicroK8s**. It‚Äôs easy to install, fully supported by Canonical, and works well on a single VM.

Here‚Äôs a clear step-by-step plan:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Update the VM

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install MicroK8s

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add your user to the `microk8s` group

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube

id $USER
```

* Log out and back in (or run `newgrp microk8s`) to apply group changes.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify MicroK8s is running

```bash
microk8s status --wait-ready
```

* You should see `microk8s is running`.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable useful add-ons

```bash
microk8s enable dns dashboard storage ingress
```

* **dns**: needed for internal service discovery
* **dashboard**: Kubernetes web UI
* **storage**: default storage class for persistent volumes

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Check nodes

```bash
microk8s kubectl get nodes
```

* Your VM should appear as `Ready`.

---

### Optional: Aliases for convenience

```bash
sudo snap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl
```

* Then you can just run `kubectl` instead of `microk8s kubectl`.

---

Once this is done, your single-node Kubernetes cluster is ready. From there, you can start deploying apps, experimenting with services, ingress, monitoring, etc.

I can also give you a **next-step roadmap** for a beginner-friendly self-hosted cluster setup with monitoring and ingress if you want.

Do you want me to do that?
